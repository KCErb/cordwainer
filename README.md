# What is Cordwainer?

I believe that the two best ways to learn something are

* get your hands dirty actually doing something, not just reading.

* teach someone else the things you learned.

That means if I want to really master [Shoes]((https://github.com/shoes/shoes4), I've got to dig through each line of code and really understand what it's doing from start to finish. Then I've got to write up what I learned as if I were teaching someone else. That write-up process is these tutorials.

# What is *A* Cordwainer?

A cordwainer is someone that makes shoes. This term distinguishes them from a cobbler, someone who maintains or repairs them. Since the Shoes 4 project is really a total rebuild of Shoes from the ground up I felt that the term Cordwainer applies to developers more than Cobbler. But I'm sure the line between them is fuzzy.

The purpose of these tutorials is primarily to be my notes as I work through the guts of [Shoes](https://github.com/shoes/shoes4), but I'd love for others to learn from them, or for other Shoes makers to pitch in as Shoes evolves. Please open up issues, submit a PR or whatever you want.
